## Week 9 Assignments

**Due Tuesday at 12pm**

### Blog post #9

Revision is important! In this post, you'll summarize the discussion in our individual meeting. How did your thinking change? What are you going to modify about your project? What further steps do you need to take? What are your very specific next steps?  

**Specs:** 
* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* 150-300 words. 
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it!
